Jobs Vs processes

. Relationship
All jobs are processes (from kernel’s view).
But not all processes are jobs (because your shell only tracks jobs it started).
For example:
A system service (systemd, sshd) = process (no job, since it’s not tied to your shell).
A script you started = process + job (if run from shell with job control).
